**CaT: CAVS Traversability Dataset for Off-Road Autonomous Driving** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the automotive industry. 

The dataset consists of 1812 images with 5392 labeled objects belonging to 3 different classes including *off road*, *sedan*, and *pickup*.

Images in the CaT dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (1268 images) and *test* (544 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 3 locations: ***power_line*** (1422 images), ***brown_field*** (200 images), and ***main_trail*** (190 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, MS, USA and Dynetics Inc., Huntsville, AL, USA.
